I have developed a user interface (UI) application using the Tkinter library. This UI application is designed to extract data from PDF files and provides a search feature for questions.

The UI is built using Tkinter and offers a seamless experience for users. It allows users to upload a PDF file, from which data can be extracted. Additionally, users can input questions to search for specific information within the PDF document.

Key features of the UI application:

User-friendly interface developed with Tkinter.
Extraction of data from uploaded PDF files.
Searching for specific information based on user-input questions.
The application streamlines the process of extracting relevant information from PDF documents, making it efficient and accessible for users.
